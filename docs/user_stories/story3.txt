As an authenticated user, and after having performed the flow mentioned in
Story 2, I will be presented with recommended recipes. If all was successful I
will be able to view this list of recipes, which contains hyperlinks to the
full recipes, as well as their names. The recipes will be appropriate for the
weather in my zip code. If all was not successful (not user error, but an error
in the application), then I will encounter an error but (most likely) be able
to have the application retry.
