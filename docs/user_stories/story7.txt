As an authenticated user, and after having gone through the flow mentioned in
Stories 2, 3, and 5, I will be presented with a screen which offers details
about food delivery services that will use my location (zip code) and fetch all
the food vendors that available for delivery. If all was successful, I will see
this list and be able to click through to further information about my desired
food source. If not all was successful, (not user error, but an error in the
application), then I will encounter an error but (most likely) be able to have
the application retry.
