As an authenticated user, and after having performed the flow mentioned in
Stories 2 and 3, I will be on the recipe-saving screen, and will have the
additional ability to reject all presented recipes. I will express this
interest by clicking an appropriately-labeled button. If all was successful the
application will advance me to the next screen (to be described in Story 7),
and otherwise, if the all was not successful (not user error, but an error in
the application), then I will encounter an error but (most likely) be able to
have the application retry.
