As an authenticated user, I will be able to, from any stage in the application,
indicate my desire to log out of the application. This will most likely be a
persistent button on all screens which the application presents. If successful,
my application session will be ended. If not successful, my application session
will continue (possibly in an inconsistent state), but I will (most likely) be
able to attempt to log out again.
