As an authenticated user, and after having performed the flow mentioned in
Stories 2 and 3, I will be able to save my recipes for later. I will do so by
clicking checkboxes next to the recipe names and then clicking a button which
indicates my desire to save them (persist them somewhere). I may receive an
informational message if I have attempted to save duplicate recipes. If all was
successful, then I will remain on the same page. If all was not successful (not
user error, but an error in the application), then I will encounter an error
but (most likely) be able to have the application retry.
