Backend
-------
We are using Python with the Flask web framework as the backend of our
application. used python flask as one of our technology stack. We considered
NodeJS as an option, but since most of our team was familiar with Python, we
decided it would be best to stick with a language that we know best, and also
to avoid having to deal with the unnecessarily asynchronous aspects of NodeJS.
We chose the the Flask web framework specifically, as there are many extensions
to the framework that make working with OAuth and working with a database
simple. Also, some team members greatly appreciate that Flask is not
batteries-included, unlike Django, which is much more prescriptive. One more
reason to choose Flask, albeit not unique to Flask, is that Jinja-style
templating languages are by far the easiest to use, when compared with
templating languages like Pug.


Frontend
--------
We don’t intend to use a bulky front-end framework like React or Angular;
for this project simply plain HTML prettified by the Bootstrap library will
suffice. We prefer functionality over complication, and don’t need any
particular fanciness offered by more complicated frameworks.


Database
--------
We are tentatively planning to use Amazon DynamoDB for our database. DynamoDB
is a NoSQL database with good performance, and well-integrated into Amazon AWS
(there’s also a local version for hacking on). DynamoDB is fast– and since
we are working at such a small scale, we believe that there’s more
performance gain from a DB which is simply fast, than from any schema
optimizations we can make on a traditional relational DB. Also, some team
members have heard lots of hype about DynamoDB, yet never used it before, so
they would like to evaluate it.
